###### Decentralized App Development
> My workflow when creating a decentralized application begins with writing & deploying a solidity smart contract to a local blockchain using truffle & ganache. I unit test the contract using assertions in Javascript or the Jest framework. Next, I model & wire the backend using Express, frontend with React & Web3. I deploy the contract to an Ethereum testnet such as Kovan, Ropsten or Rinkeby using the Remix IDE. Finally, I deploy the smartcontract(s) to Ethereum Mainnet & webapp assets to the InterPlanetary Filesystem (IPFS).
